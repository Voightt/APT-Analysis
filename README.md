# APT-Analysis
Analyzing Advanced Persistent Threats on a live network
---------------------------------
This project was my independent study final thesis for my last semester at college. Dr.Leune of the computer science department at Adelphi was my mentor and assisted me. This spanned across two semesters, where the first semester consisted of discovering what my thesis was going to be and planning, so that the second semester would involve conducting the research and coming to a conclusion based off of the findings.

I investigated how advanced persistent threats can be detected on a live network. Based on indicators of activity, I attempted to develop a proof-of-concept that applied these indicators to a live network.

My results are found in the pdf that is in the main branch!
